# Data-Mining-Project
Analyzing Gender Perceptions in Dating App Data and Movie Preferences.

# Problem Statement
This study intends to investigate how one gender views the other
(male for female and female for male) on a dating app, with a particular emphasis on the
qualities that the other gender finds appealing. This study will also examine how media
affects personal preferences and possible biological explanations for gender-specific
preferences. The study will make use of two datasets to do this: one from the dating app and
the other from user reviews and movie ratings finally we will use MTBI personality prediction
for several users based on their reviews on the movie or in dating app data.
