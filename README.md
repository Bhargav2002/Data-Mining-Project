# Data-Mining-Project
Analyzing Gender Perceptions in Dating App Data and Movie Preferences.

# Problem Statement
This study intends to investigate how one gender views the other
(male for female and female for male) on a dating app, with a particular emphasis on the
qualities that the other gender finds appealing. This study will also examine how media
affects personal preferences and possible biological explanations for gender-specific
preferences. The study will make use of two datasets to do this: one from the dating app and
the other from user reviews and movie ratings finally we will use MTBI personality prediction
for several users based on their reviews on the movie or in dating app data.

# Data Acquisition

To acquire the OkCupid dataset , an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the platform was utilized. This API granted access to a comprehensive dataset comprising nearly 60,000 data entries, each containing a multitude of columns featuring diverse information.
On the other hand, the MovieLens dataset was acquired directly from the official MovieLens website. This dataset boasted a vast collection of approximately 1 million data points. It primarily included key demographic information such as occupation, gender, and age, which played a crucial role in the context of this research. Additionally, the Movie-Lens dataset offered an extensive array of genre-related data, encompassing various genres, the movies contained within those genres, and their corresponding ratings. Acquiring these datasets through distinct methods ensured a varied and comprehensive dataset, which was essential for meeting the objectives of this study.

# Methodology
In this study, we investigate the correlation between individualsâ€™ dating preferences and movie choices using three datasets: OkCupid profiles, the Movielens 1M dataset, and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset. Data preprocessing for the OkCupid dataset involved stratification into classes based on user age groups and gender, following the taxonomy established by the Movielens dataset. The methodology employs a two-part parallel approach, with the first part focusing on OkCupid dataset analysis, and the second part on Movielens and MBTI dataset analysis. To validate our findings, tests were conducted to assess the consistency of observations between the OkCupid and Movielens/MBTI segments.

Understanding demographic differences and linguistic nuances is necessary to provide insight into personal preferences and behaviors. We investigated the use of two different methods, the Fp-growth algorithm and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to disclose important details regarding the most common types of jobs for specific age and gender groups as well as important words and language patterns in these groups. By combining these methods, we hope to promote a deeper understanding of the relationship between language preferences and demography and provide significant new information in this area.
